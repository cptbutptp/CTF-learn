Metasploit Modules
==================

These scripts are a holding place while they get tweaked for inclusion
to the Metasploit framework. If you want to play with them before they
are included feel free. Add them to the modules/auxiliary/scanner/snmp
directory and good luck!

Known issues
============

 * H3C config eater not ready yet
 * H3C config downloader not 100% effective yet, needs more testing
