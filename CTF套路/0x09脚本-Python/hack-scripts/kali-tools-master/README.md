# Kali Tools

This script enables to run **all kali tools**, on every Linux distributions. More specifically, it allows cloning the source repo of the packages (and automatically install them if needed), per package, as needed.

Additionnally, it allows **searching** for tools, a feature I was dearly missing even in Kali. Searching works on packages name **and descriptions** (which were manually curated, then hardcoded in this repo to avoid unneeded network access).

Inspired from [LionSec/Katoolin](https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin), but not restricted to Ubuntu/Debian.
