New for MOCKS version 0.0.2

  * Added support for upstream proxy connection. MOCKS can now relay all
    traffic by acting like a client for another proxy server. This is not
    yet fully implemented: BIND commands are not yet relayed. Supported
    upstream proxy protocols: HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS4, SOCKS5.
    For details see the UP_PROXY_* variables in mocks.conf.
  
  * Added IP-based client filter. MOCKS can now reject client connections
    based on filtering rules.
    For details see the FILTER_* variables in mocks.conf.

  * Added bounding IP option. You can tell MOCKS the IP address it should
    listen for client connections on. By default it binds like MOCKS 0.0.1 to 
    all interfaces.
    For details see the MOCKS_ADDR variable in mocks.conf.

  * Fixed some include problems that were causing GCC to issue some warnings.
